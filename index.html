<p>
Homelessness is a topic that divides us; and whilst levels of homelessness increase with austerity, opinions of the homeless haven’t much changed. 
</p>
<p>
As a nation, many feel that people are homeless because they’ve taken the wrong roads in life, that they’ve made the wrong decisions; ultimately, that it’s their fault. 
</p>
<p>
According to The Poverty Page, the most common cause of homelessness is a loss of accommodation provided by friends or relatives. Homeless people, as experts are keen to articulate, are not just those walking around with four cans of Special Brew.
</p>
<p>
Walking through Sheffield, you encounter homeless people of all shapes, sizes and genders. There are migrant women, young people, ex-military men and old agers. Homelessness doesn’t discriminate. As Graham Bostock, community leader at Sheffield Emmaus, said: “We’re all just a little step away from homelessness.”
</p>
<h4>Should we give beggars money?</h4>
<p>
One question, perhaps the question that divides us most of all, is whether we should give beggars money. Some choose not to, believing it contributes to a cycle of street sleeping and addiction. Some hand over what change they have in their pockets. Others bridge the gap, buying the beggar a sandwich, a chocolate bar, a bottle of water.
</p>
<p>
We spoke to three separate organisations working with the homeless. They told us what work they do and whether or not we should give money to beggars.

<section class="content">

  <p>Emmaus was set up by after World War 2 by Abbé Pierre, a Catholic priest, MP and resistance fighter.  </p>
   <p>
Abbe Pierre was approached one night by a man named Georges, who after being released from a 20 year prison sentence, had tried to commit suicide. He turned to the Abbe for help, who in turn asked Georges for help in building houses for homeless mothers. 
</p>
 
  <p>
Emmaus is now worldwide, and has over 20 communities in England alone. 
 </p>
   <p>
Sheffield’s Emmaus, which started up in 2007, is situated near Sheffield City Centre’s canal basin, a five minute walk from the town. 
</p>
<p>Graham Bostock, community leader at Emmaus Sheffield, said: “The whole ethos of Emmaus is that the homeless come to live here. They sign off any primary benefits and they live and work 40 hours in an ordinary working environment.”
</p>

  <p>

The homeless who stay in an Emmaus community are called ‘companions’, and they engage in a variety of work, such as recycling, refurbishment, gardening and PAT testing.<p/>
<p>“The whole point is if people are working they gain back confidence and self-esteem and eventually can go back into society” said Bostock. 
</p>
<p>The Sheffield Emmaus community has 18 en-suite bedrooms, a dining room and kitchen, a small gym and laundry facilities. 
</p>

“Somebody cooks every evening during the week, and there’s a lunch at 12:30pm where we all take part. 
 </p>
<p>“We encourage everybody to take part in the community and keep it clean and tidy. This isn’t a hostel, we don’t like to be referred to as that. For as long as they stay here this is their home,” said Bostock. 
</p>
<p>To ensure Emmaus is a safe and secure environment, the rules of accommodation are strict and severe; no drugs, no alcohol, no violence. However, anybody struggling is encouraged to seek help from the staff at Emmaus. 
</p>
<p>Bostock said: “If somebody creates problems in our community through violence, drugs or alcohol, they are asked to leave. But if someone is struggling, we ask that they come see us, and we can liaise with drug, alcohol or mental health services and support a companion through their problems.
</p>

  “The ultimate goal is to be completely self-sufficient.” - Graham Bostock
</blockquote>
<p>
“However, it’s important to remember that we’re all a little step away from homelessness. Homelessness isn’t just your guy who wants to walk around with a bottle in their pocket. We’ve had here police officers, solicitors, graduates. People become homeless for a multitude of reasons.
</p>
<p>“But anybody who says anyone would rather stay on the streets than be in a nice warm bed is talking absolute rubbish. I think that’s a fallacy.”
</p>
 <p>
When asked what’s next for Emmaus Sheffield, Bostock hammered home the point that they are keen on being independent, and that sums up the whole ethos of Emmaus; to be self-sufficient, independent, to work hard and to reap the rewards.</p>
 <p>“The charity shop alone selling furniture doesn’t make enough money to keep us running” said Bostock. “It costs us £350,000 a year to run the community, and we’re still £50,000 short, but we’re increasing turnover year on year by 10 per cent. We’re doing all we can to support ourselves and that saves us from having to go around with a begging bowl.
</p>
<p>“The ultimate goal is to be completely self-sufficient.”

 “We face complex issues everyday” said Zoe Young, Housing Service and Advice Service Manager. “A minority of people have really high and complex needs; drug and alcohol addictions, long term physical problems, vast criminal convictions and mental illnesses all combined. One problem is getting this person to engage with us and the other services. 
</p>
<p>
 “Another issue comes with funding. When you’re dealing with vulnerable and homeless people, there’s never enough money and you can always do more.
 </p>
<p>
“Something else you might find interesting, that we have to deal with every day since social media began. We receive phone calls from people who have seen a social media campaign; there’ll have been a post shared and viewed thousands of times, saying that a certain homeless person isn’t being helped in any way. 
</p>

<p>“Actually, there’s a lot of work gone into that person, and they just don’t want to move on. Dealing with those phone calls take up a lot of time we could be using more positively in actually helping people.” 
<aside> <h5>19%</h5><p>The percentage of St Mungo’s female clients that were found to have experienced abuse as a child, according to Rebuilding Shattered Lives, a report by the charity. Half of the women said they had experienced domestic violence and a third said it had contributed to their homelessness.</p>
 </aside>
<p>The Housing Options and Advice Service are the City Council’s department dealing with homelessness and rough sleeping. They decide who is in priority need of housing, match people to the right accommodation and refer people to the Greens, an addiction rehabilitation centre. 
</p>

<p>Another service offered by the Housing Options and Advice Service is housing women fleeing domestic abuse, ‘the sanctuary scheme.’ This is especially important, considering 20 per cent of women who are homeless are escaping violence from someone they know, according to Crisis. 
</p>

<p>They also check whether a landlord’s decision to kick someone out of a property is legal. 
</p>




<p>Young said: “We always aim to prevent homelessness in the first place. 
</p>

<p>
“There’s only about 11 rough sleepers in Sheffield. Rough sleeping is the most visible sign of homelessness. Most people do have somewhere to go.”
</p>

<p>
In April 2016, a petition seeking abandoned buildings to be opened for homeless people to shelter in was rejected by the council.
</p><figure>

<p>
“It all started off the back of what Gary Neville did in Manchester. Squatters were staying in a hotel he was building, and so he decided to open it up for the homeless.
</p>
<p>
“Here in Sheffield, we don’t have enough rough sleepers to justify opening up the abandoned buildings. 
</p>
<p>“Plus, there’s too many issues surrounding health and safety. It would need to be staffed around the clock.”
</p> <blockquote class="right">
  “We face many complex issues everyday” - Zoe Young
</blockquote>
<p>
In terms of how well Sheffield is dealing with homelessness, Young said: “We’re very lucky in Sheffield, because we still have quite a lot of provision in comparison to Manchester and London. 
</p>

<p>“In Sheffield we’re bucking the trend for who we class as homeless. We’ve actually seen a decrease in the number of homeless people, but in other areas the numbers are increasing.
</p>
<p>“This is due to the prevention work we’re doing and our getting the homeless into supported accommodation as soon as possible.”

    <h1>Cathedral Archer Project</h1>
    <h2>Giving the homeless opportunity and choices </h2>
  </header>
</section>


<section class="content">


<p>
 The Cathedral Archer Project has its roots in the unemployment of the 1980s.
</p>

<p>
After a decade of decline in Sheffield’s industry, many people found themselves in the grips of poverty and ill health.
</p>
<blockquote class="right">
 "People will walk through the doors when they’re ready." - Andy Parfrement
</blockquote>
<p>
By 1989, Sheffield Cathedral had become a haven for those with nowhere else to turn. They were given a breakfast by the congregation, with Church Army Captain Alan Turner overseeing the affair. This was the beginnings of the Cathedral Archer Project. 
</p> 


<p>In 2007, the Project moved to its own premises at the back of the Cathedral, fitted with a kitchen, a lounge, showers and laundry services, a medical room and an education room. 
</p>

<p>
Andy Parfrement, manager at the Project, said: “We provide basic support in terms of shower facilities, food, literacy and numeracy lessons, help with job searches, leisure activities such as photography, football, comic making and art groups. 
</p>
<section class="archer video_container" id="_video">

<p>
“We also have an onsite nurse, dentist and chiropodist, an advice worker that comes from the councils housing and advice service; all the different things a homeless person might need.
</p>
<p>“I think Sheffield are doing okay with the homelessness problem. Generally we have quite a low homeless population, less than London and Manchester. The services are here if any homeless person needs them, and if the homeless present to housing solutions, they will be accommodated.”

<p>
 One major tool in the battle against homelessness is the connection between the homeless services of Sheffield; as Zoe Young said, “we deal with services like Turning Point and the Cathedral Archer Project every hour of every day.”
</p>
<p>
Turning Point - an organisation dealing with homelessness, addiction, learning difficulties, and mental illness - actually has its Sheffield branch at the back of the Cathedral, on the same site as the Project. 
</p>

<p>
 “One of the good things about being so connected with the other services is there’s now a faster route into treatment for addiction than there was ten years ago. It only takes a few weeks to get into treatment now, where as it was three to six months in times gone by.
</p>

<p>
“One thing that we can’t deal with though, and a lot of it is to do with national policy, is migrants who are homeless. They don’t have passports or formal documents, so we can only feed them and send them away. We can’t put them in housing. We can’t help them with job searches” said Parfrement.
</p>
<p>
After twenty five years of service to the homeless community, the Project is still going strong, and has gained a reputation as one of Sheffield’s most successful organisations in the battle against homelessness, giving the vulnerable the basic support they need whilst referring them to services who can offer longer-lasting solutions.
</p>
<p>
“All in all, I think what we try to do at project is give people opportunity and choices, and people will walk through the doors when they’re ready” said Parfrement.
